#$ AUTHOR: ctzsnooze
#$ DESCRIPTION: RC smoothing settings for general/fast Freestyle flying.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Fixed cutoff frequency for consistent, responsive results over a wide range of RC link frequencies.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Note: Auto-smoothing cutoff values are over-ridden by the fixed cutoff values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: There is no need to turn off feedforward or to enable transition, beause the jitter reduction provides dynamic attenuation of feedforward whenever the sticks move slowly.
